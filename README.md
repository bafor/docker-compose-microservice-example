# dokcer-compose-microservice-example
###I want to play with docker and microservices architecture.

##First step:
- Two "apps"
- both running on containers with php 7.4 and internal php web server
- one `micorservices/app` call `micorservices/timer` to display current date.

To run it just execute `docker-compose up`. 
To install docker-compose look at:
- https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/ 
- https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/

Look at: `http://localhost:8020/` to see a results
